# Assignment-3-ASP.NET
YakBak is a fun little project where you can join or create “clans” (groups) based on your interests. Whether it’s movies, gaming, tech, or anything else, YakBak gives you a space to find like‑minded people.

It’s built with ASP.NET Core MVC, has local login and social logins with Google and GitHub, and is fully cloud‑deployed.

Finished with Sign-up using Google, Github and Local.
